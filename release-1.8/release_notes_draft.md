## **Major Themes**

- The kubernetes workloads API (the DaemonSet, Deployment, ReplicaSet, and 
StatefulSet kinds) have been promoted to the new apps/v1beta2 group version. This
is the current version of the API, and the version we intend to promote to 
GA in future releases. This version of the API introduces several deprecations 
and behavioral changes, and its intention is to provide a stable, consistent 
API surface for promotion. 

## **Action Required Before Upgrading**

* The autoscaling/v2alpha1 API has graduated to autoscaling/v2beta1.  The
  form remains unchanged.  HorizontalPodAutoscalers making use of features
  from the autoscaling/v2alpha1 API will need to be migrated to
  autoscaling/v2beta1 to ensure that the new features are properly
  persisted.

* The metrics APIs (`custom.metrics.metrics.k8s.io` and `metrics`) have
  graduated from `v1alpha1` to `v1beta1`.  If you have deployed a custom
  metrics adapter, ensure that it supports the new API version.  If you
  have deployed Heapster in aggregated API server mode, ensure that you
  upgrade Heapster as well. 

## **Known Issues**

## **Deprecations**

### Apps 
 - The .spec.rollbackTo field of the Deployment kind is deprecated in the
 extensions/v1beta1 group version.
 - The pod.alpha.kubernetes.io/initialized has been removed.


## **Notable Features**

### [Workload API (apps/v1beta2)](https://github.com/kubernetes/features/issues/353)

Kubernetes 1.8 adds the apps/v1beta2 group version. This group version contains 
the Kubernetes workload API which consists of the DaemonSet, Deployment, 
ReplicaSet and StatefulSet kinds. It is the current version of the API, and we 
intend to promote it to GA in upcoming releases 

#### API Object Additions and Migrations

- The current version DaemonSet, Deployment, ReplicaSet, and StatefulSet kinds 
  are now in the apps/v1beta2 group version.
- The apps/v1beta2 group version adds a Scale subresource for the StatefulSet 
kind.
- All kinds in the apps/v1beta2 group version add a corresponding conditions 
  kind.

#### Behavioral Changes

 - For all kinds in the API group version, as it is incompatible with kubectl 
 apply and strategic merge patch, spec.selector defaulting is disabled. Users
 must set the spec.selector in their manifests, and the creation of an object 
 with a spec.selector that does not match the labels in its spec.template is 
 considered to be invalid.
 - As none of the controllers in the workloads API handle selector mutation in 
 a consistent way, selector mutation is disabled in for all kinds in the 
 app/v1beta2 group version. This restriction may be lifted in the future, but 
 it is likely that that selectors will remain immutable after GA promotion. 
 Users that have any code that depends on mutable selectors may continue to use 
 the apps/v1beta1 API for this release, but they should begin migration to code 
 that does depend on mutable selectors.

 #### Defaults

 - The default spec.updateStrategy for the StatefulSet and DaemonSet kinds is 
 RollingUpdate for the apps/v1beta2 group version. Users may specifically set 
 the OnDelete strategy, and no strategy auto-conversion will be applied to 
 replace defaulted values.
 - As mentioned in [Behavioral Changes](#behavioral-changes), selector 
 defaulting is disabled.
 - The default spec.revisionHistoryLimit for all applicable kinds in the 
 apps/v1beta2 group version has set to 10.

#### CLI Changes

- The kubectl rollout and rollback implementation is complete for StatefulSet.
- The kubectl scale command will uses the Scale subresource for kinds in the 
  apps/v1beta2 group.
- kubectl delete will no longer scale down workload API objects prior to 
  deletion. Users who depend on ordered termination for the Pods of their 
  StatefulSetâ€™s must use kubectl scale to scale down the StatefulSet prior to 
  deletion.

#### Scheduling
* [alpha] Support pod priority and creation of PriorityClasses ([design doc](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/design-proposals/pod-priority-api.md))
* [alpha] Support priority-based preemption of pods ([design doc](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/design-proposals/pod-preemption.md))
* [alpha] Taint nodes by condition ([design doc](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/design-proposals/taint-node-by-condition.md))

#### Storage

* Capacity Isolation/Resource Management for Local Ephemeral Storage
* Block Volumes Support
* Enable containerization of mount dependencies
* Support Attach/Detach for RWO volumes such as iSCSI, Fibre Channel and RBD
* Volume Plugin Metrics
* Snapshots
* Resizing Volume Support
* Exposing StorageClass Params To End Users (aka Provisioning configuration in PVC)
* Mount Options to GA
* Allow configuration of reclaim policy in StorageClass
* Expose Storage Usage Metrics
* PV spec refactoring for plugins that reference namespaced resources: Azure File, CephFS, iSCSI, Glusterfs

### **Node Components**
#### kubelet
* [alpha] Kubelet now supports alternative container-level CPU affinity policies using new CPU manager. ([#375](https://github.com/kubernetes/features/issues/375), [@sjenning](https://github.com/sjenning), [@ConnorDoyle](https://github.com/ConnorDoyle)

* [alpha] Applications may now request pre-allocated hugepages by using the new `hugepages` resource in the container resource requests. [#275](https://github.com/kubernetes/features/issues/275), [@derekwaynecarr](https://github.com/derekwaynecarr)

* when `--bootstrap-kubeconfig` is enabled on a kubelet, the client certificate
  will automatically be renewed as it approaches expiration.

* [alpha] Add limited support for pod "checkpointing" in the kubelet to help enable self-hosting. ([#378](https://github.com/kubernetes/features/issues/378), [@timothysc](https://github.com/timothysc))


#### Autoscaling and Metrics

* Support for custom metrics in the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler is moving to
  beta.  The associated metrics APIs (custom metrics and resource/master
  metrics) are graduating to v1beta1.  See [Action Required Before
  Upgrading](#action-required-before-upgrading).

### **Cluster Lifecycle**
#### kubeadm
* [beta] A new `phase` subcommand supports performing only subtasks of the full `kubeadm init` flow. Combined with fine-grained configuration, kubeadm is now more easily consumable by higher-level provisioning tools like kops or GKE. ([#356](https://github.com/kubernetes/features/issues/356), [@luxas](https://github.com/luxas), [@justinsb](https://github.com/justinsb))

* [beta] A new `upgrade` subcommand allows you to automatically upgrade a self-hosted cluster created with kubeadm. ([#296](https://github.com/kubernetes/features/issues/296), [@luxas](https://github.com/luxas))

#### kops
* [alpha] Added support for targeting bare metal (or non-cloudprovider) machines. ([#360](https://github.com/kubernetes/features/issues/360), [@justinsb](https://github.com/justinsb)).

* [alpha] kops now supports [running as a server](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/blob/master/docs/api-server/README.md). ([#359](https://github.com/kubernetes/features/issues/359), [@justinsb](https://github.com/justinsb)).

* [beta] GCE support has been promoted from alpha to beta. ([#358](https://github.com/kubernetes/features/issues/358), [@justinsb](https://github.com/justinsb)).

#### Cluster Discovery/Bootstrap

* [beta] The authentication and verification mechanism called Bootstrap Tokens has been added to the core API, which can be used to easily add new members to a cluster. ([#130](https://github.com/kubernetes/features/issues/130), [@luxas](https://github.com/luxas), [@jbeda](https://github.com/jbeda)).

#### Addons
* [alpha] A new system addon manager is available that is aiming to improve the downsides of the existing `kube-addons.sh` manager. ([#18](https://github.com/kubernetes/features/issues/18), [@justinsb](https://github.com/justinsb))

#### Multi-platform
* [beta] Kubernetes now has automated continuous-integration tests against all of our supported platforms (amd64, armhfp, aarch64, ppc64le), to ensure that it continues to work on these platforms. It's also possible to run clusters with nodes of mixed architectures. ([#288](https://github.com/kubernetes/features/issues/288), [@luxas](https://github.com/luxas), [@mkumatag](https://github.com/mkumatag), [@ixdy](https://github.com/ixdy))

#### Cloud Providers
* [beta] Support for out-of-tree and out-of-process cloud providers, a.k.a pluggable providers, has been promoted from alpha to beta. ([#88](https://github.com/kubernetes/features/issues/88), [@wlan0](https://github.com/wlan0))

#### DaemonSet
* [beta] DaemonSet upgrades can be achieved via a start-then-kill update strategy. ([#373](https://github.com/kubernetes/features/issues/373), [@aaronlevy](https://github.com/aaronlevy), [@diegs](https://github.com/diegs))
